2. Requirements
---------------

LabView:
	Version 8.0 or higher
		
Linux:
	Libraries: pthread
	The SO library was created with
	  - Kernel 3.1.0
	  - gcc 4.6.2
	  - libc 2.14.1

Windows:
	Operating system: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7,
                          Windows 8.1, Windows 10
	Libraries: user32.lib, ws2_32.lib, kernel32.lib



3. Initial Setup
----------------

Installing the software
-----------------------

As described in the manual, the driver files (eib7.dll/eib7_64.dll or 
libeib7.so/libeib7_64.so) must be copied from the CD to the system directory. 
After this the contents of the "EIB_741_742" folder on the CD must be copied to 
any directory on the local hard disk. The examples and tools can then be used.

Establishing a network connection to the EIB 700
------------------------------------------------
During initial setup, the EIB 700 must be connected to the computer via a 
point-to-point network connection and then configured. Before connecting the 
network cable to the computer, the following TCP/IP configuration must be set 
for the network card used:

- Use specific IP address (do not automatically procure)
- IP address:   192.168.1.1
- Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

Once these settings have been entered, the network cable must be connected to 
the computer and the EIB 700, and the EIB 700 must be switched on. 
The EIB 700 is ready for operation as soon as the STATUS LED is lit.

Testing the connection
---------------------
It is recommended that you first test via a ping command (DOS console or 
Linux shell) whether the EIB 700 can be addressed over the network. This 
should be the case if all steps have been followed correctly.

Command:
ping 192.168.1.2

The console reports whether the EIB 700 can be addressed.
If it can, then the tools and example programs can be used. In some of these 
programs the IP address of the EIB 700 must be entered. The factory default 
setting for the EIB 700 is 192.168.1.2.

If the network parameters of the EIB 700 have already been changed, then the
EIB 700 cannot be addressed via the standard IP address (192.168.1.2). If 
this is the case, then booting with the standard network settings is 
recommended. (See Installation Instructions, “Reset Modes” section)

Configuration of the network parameters of the EIB 700
------------------------------------------------------
This is done with the “networksettings” tool (see below).
It is used to configure the EIB 700 for your network environment.

Running the examples and tools
------------------------------
The programs included for Windows and Linux are run directly by the 
console (shell). The LabView programs are available as VIs.



4. Examples
-----------

C/C++ examples for Windows and Linux
------------------------------------

AuxAxis:
--------
The position values of the encoder at axis 1 can be saved via two different 
trigger sources. The auxiliary axis is used for this purpose. 
An encoder with incremental signals must be connected to axis 1. The position
values are saved periodically via the internal timer trigger. At the same 
time, the position can be saved with a second, asynchronous trigger signal.

-----
Axis 1 of the EIB 700 is initialized for encoders with incremental signals. 
The position value and status word of this axis are requested and displayed. 
The IP address of the EIB 700 must be 192.168.1.2.

select the axis whose position values are to be read. The program also 
interrogates the type of encoder interface. The user can choose between 
Incremental, EnDat 2.1 and EnDat 2.2. The position values are continually 
read in a loop. The IP address of the EIB 700 must be entered after the 
program has been started.

Streaming mode for this. Data for four axes is transmitted. The user can select
which of the four axes is to be displayed. Furthermore, the user can choose 
between external and internal triggering. The position values are continually 
read in a loop. The IP address of the EIB 700 is interrogated after the 
program has been started.

recording:
----------
The position value, status word, timestamp and trigger counter for a 
selectable axis are recorded in the EIB 700. The EIB 700 is operated in 
Recording mode for this. The data package is configured such that only the 
data for the corresponding axis is recorded. After the recording phase, the 
data is transmitted to the PC and displayed. The IP address of the EIB 700 
is interrogated after the program has been started. The user can choose between 
external and internal triggering.

TriggerIO:

The position value, status word, timestamp and trigger counter for an 
axis of the EIB 700 are read and displayed. The EIB 700 is operated in 
Soft Realtime mode for this. All axes are configured for incremental 
encoders. The user can select which of the four axes is to be displayed. 
Triggering occurs via an internal timer trigger. 
In addition to this, the trigger signal is output at trigger output 1. The 
IP address of the EIB 700 is interrogated after the program has been started.

selectable axis of the EIB 700 are read and displayed. The EIB 700 is 
operated in Soft Realtime mode for this. Triggering is done via the reference 
mark of the encoder. The IP address of the EIB 700 is interrogated after 
the program has been started.
